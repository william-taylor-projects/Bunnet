Bunnet is just a small little idea to see how I can visualise flat files to provide a uniform searching and querying tool for the common construct. What exists in this repository is just me playing around with this idea amongst other things including seeing if a Morgan Stanley material theme would look good and learning a bit more about websockets in the world of Spring.
